# 🏛️ Solto Wallet — Smart, Secure Solana Wallet with AI-Powered Risk Analysis

**Solto** is a fast, secure, and intuitive wallet built for the Solana ecosystem.  
It integrates real-time AI analysis to help users make confident decisions while managing their assets with ease and clarity.

## 🔑 Key Features

### ✳ Token Behavior Scan  
Detects risky token properties such as open minting, active freeze authority, or unlocked liquidity — common indicators of malicious or unstable tokens.

### ✳ Risk Alert Score Engine  
Calculates a token's trust score based on factors like blacklist presence, recent contract ownership changes, and liquidity lock status.

### ✳ Whale Cluster Detection  
Analyzes token holder distribution to flag centralization risks — often a precursor to manipulation or rug pull behavior.

### ✳ Sync Risk Tagging  
Simplifies token analysis by converting raw scores into visual tags:  
- **Safe** — Low-risk token  
- **Watch** — Proceed with caution  
- **Risk** — High-risk behavior detected

### ✳ Insight Feed Update  
Maintains a token’s behavioral history to improve AI learning over time — helping users track risk evolution and make informed decisions.

## 🧠 AI Functionality

Solto integrates a modular AI engine to provide real-time risk insight, token safety scoring, and adaptive learning.  
Each function enhances wallet intelligence and user safety.

### ✳ Token Behavior Scan  
**Detects suspicious token settings**

```python
def analyze_token_behavior(token):
    risk_flags = []
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open":
        risk_flags.append("Unrestricted Minting")
    if token.get("freeze_authority") == "active":
        risk_flags.append("Can Freeze Transfers")
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", False):
        risk_flags.append("Unlocked Liquidity")
    return risk_flags
```
#### AI Context:
Filters token traits against known exploit patterns and scam logic from real-world rug pulls and honeypots.

### ✳ Risk Alert Score Engine
#### Scores tokens based on critical risk indicators

```python
def calculate_risk_score(token):
    score = 100
    if token.get("blacklist", False):
        score -= 40
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open":
        score -= 25
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", True):
        score -= 20
    if token.get("owner_changed_recently", False):
        score -= 15
    return max(0, score)
```
#### AI Context:
Model trained on real token failure data. Refines scores using historical exploit feedback and live event loops.

### ✳ Whale Cluster Detection
#### Identifies high holder concentration

```js
function detectWhales(holders) {
  const whales = holders.filter(h => h.balance >= 0.05);
  return whales.length > 5 ? 'Whale Concentration Detected' : 'No Whale Clusters';
}
```
#### AI Context:
Highlights centralization risks by clustering wallet balances — often a precursor to price volatility or sudden dumps.

### ✳ Sync Risk Tagging
#### Translates score into human-readable category

```js
function assignTag(score) {
  if (score >= 80) return "Safe";
  if (score >= 50) return "Watch";
  return "Risk";
}
```
#### AI Context:
Applies adaptive thresholds tuned by AI to convert numeric risk into intuitive trust levels — used across UI tagging.

### ✳ Insight Feed Update
#### Logs token analysis for AI training

```python
from datetime import datetime

def update_insights(token_id, label, score):
    insight_entry = {
        "token": token_id,
        "risk_label": label,
        "score": score,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
    if token_id not in insights_db:
        insights_db[token_id] = insight_entry
    else:
        insights_db[token_id].update(insight_entry)
```
#### AI Context:
Stores real-time token scoring and tagging history. Enables feedback loop and continuous AI model refinement.
